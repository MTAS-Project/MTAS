To dos:
	get coarse location				
	only wifi uploading option
	upload to playstore
	No crashes
	


Future:
	-cluster report when tapped
	-big downloaded data? ask server to send limited amount of data(receptions)
	-so much uploaded data (stored in local db for “my receps” activity)? remove some 	uploaded receptions. but not those which are not uploaded yet.
